#Edison/Tesla
`STSE` `Edison` `Tesla` `Physics`

I wrote this STSE today.

##1 Pre-Research
From what I know of Edison and Tesla, they had a pretty bitter rivalry. Tesla was arguably the greatest engineering genius of his time, but he was really weird. In the eyes of the media, Edison was the greatest engineering mind--but I’m pretty sure he copied most of his “inventions”. However, since the media endorsed Edison and not Tesla, Edison made a lot of money while I’m pretty sure Tesla died in a hotel room on a diet of crackers and water. Tesla is well known for the Tesla coil, and also he said he invented a death ray and a source of infinite energy (he was a little crazy). If I’m not wrong, Edison was credited with the invention of the lightbulb--a  highly controversial accreditation, to be sure.

##2 The War of the Currents
The “War of the Currents” was quite a bloody war for no human casualties. In order to convince the public of the danger of the high voltage AC power grid, Edison aided Harold Brown--an electrical engineer--in the public execution of multiple dogs with AC current. They first showed how a dog could sustain shocks of up to 1000 volts DC and then shocked the dog with 300-330 volts AC, which killed it. Even with this demonstration, the benefits of AC far outweighed those of DC: being able to run AC at a high voltage allowed power to be sent from far distances at minimal cost when compared to the required locality of a DC power generating station. Thus, since it was cheaper to generate and distribute AC power, Tesla’s choice of AC won out over Edison’s choice of DC.

##3 Post-research
Tesla was well known as a “mad scientist”. He was pretty crazy. In the later stages of his life, he fed pigeons almost religiously and spent $2000 to build a device to heal a single pigeon whom he was quoted as saying he “loved . . . as a man loves a woman”. Crazy as he was, he had a huge number of inventions--at least 278 patented ones, and numerous more unpatented ones. Of defining moments in his life, I had known already about most of the scientific ones, but I didn’t know about his life prior to coming to America. One defining moment for Tesla was when he was forced to drop out of university and ran away from his entire life. Another defining moment for him was when he quit the Continental Edison Company due to Edison’s failure to reward him as he had promised. This experience founded the bitter rivalry between Tesla and Edison, the future basis for the “War of the Currents”. A final life experience that was foundational to Tesla’s life was the failure of J. P. Morgan to deliver on the funding he had promised to Tesla. This failure to find funding meant that Tesla had to abandon the most ambitious project of his life, a true tragedy.

Edison, on the other hand, is considered by many to be one of the best inventors of all-time. Because I had previously only really learned about Tesla, I had a pretty negative view of him and this research opened my eyes to the genius that Edison really was. His first real defining moment was his invention of the phonograph, which garnered him international media attention and allowed him to start procuring the funding for his second defining moment: the formation of Menlo Park. Edison’s Menlo Park was a world-first: a research lab that was dedicated to innovation and invention. It was in this lab that Edison had his third big defining moment, the one that I had known him for, the invention of the incandescent light bulb. Edison had over 1000 patents in his name, an incredible feat for which he should be commended and remembered for, even with his unfortunate dealings with Tesla.

This research changed my opinion on Edison a great deal, as I grew to respect him much more. I already knew most of what I read about Tesla, but reading about his early life was pretty incredible--I think it’s pretty crazy that someone as prolific as Tesla could start inventing when he was in his mid-twenties, after dropping out of university and facing life-threatening diseases and a gambling addiction. His story was much more than that of a “mad scientist”, he was an interesting person with an incredible story and it would be a shame to remember him as otherwise. While both Edison and Tesla had their shortcomings, especially in their dealings with one another, they should be remembered as two of the greatest inventive minds of modern history--if not all of history.
